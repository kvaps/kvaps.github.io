This guide is a free interpretation of official [Creating Highly Available Clusters with kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/high-availability/) for [Stacked control plane nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/high-availability/#stacked-control-plane-nodes). I donâ€™t like this difficult form which used there, so I wrote this article.

If you have any questions, or something is not clear, please refer to the official documentation or ask the [Google](https://www.google.com/). All steps described here in the short and simple form
