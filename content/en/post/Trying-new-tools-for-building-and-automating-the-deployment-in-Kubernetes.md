Hi!  
Recently, many cool automation tools have been released both for building Docker images and for deploying to Kubernetes. In this regard, I decided to play with the Gitlab a little, study its capabilities and, of course, configure the pipeline.

The source of inspiration for this work was the site [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/), which is automatically generated from [source code](github.com/kubernetes/website).  
For each new pullrequest the bot generates a preview version with your changes automatically and provides a link for review.

I tried to build a similar process from scratch, but entirely built on Gitlab CI and free tools that I used to use to deploy applications in Kubernetes. Today, I finally will tell you more about them.

The article will consider such tools as: **Hugo**, **qbec**, **kaniko**, **git-crypt** and **GitLab CI** with dynamic environments feature.
