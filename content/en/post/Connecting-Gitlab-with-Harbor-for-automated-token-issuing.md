Gitlab CI have a nice feature to generate docker-registry tokens per each job, but this feature is working only for itâ€™s own docker registry and does not working with an external ones, eg. Harbor, Nexus, Quay and etc.

There is an opportunity to set-up external docker registry for Gitlab, it is well described in the documentation [Use an external container registry with GitLab as an auth endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/packages/container_registry.html#use-an-external-container-registry-with-gitlab-as-an-auth-endpoint).

Proposed to configure brand new docker-registry with token based authentication. Harbor also uses docker-registry in backend, so that we could configure it, but problem is that both Gitlab and Harbor require to set their own parameters which are actually conflicts.
