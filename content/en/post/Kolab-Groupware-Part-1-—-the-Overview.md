Hi, Habr! I want to tell you about a rather interesting and functional replacement for MS Exchange, completely free and also with a beautiful web-muzzle. The conversation will be about Kolab - a free mail server with support for collaboration, calendars, to-do lists, WebDAV, ActiveSync synchronization and other goodies that can be used both for work and for home.

*Carefully, in a post a lot of pictures...*
