Not so long ago, the guys from LINBIT presented their new SDS solution – Linstor. This is a fully free storage based on proven technologies: DRBD, LVM, ZFS. Linstor combines simplicity and well-developed architecture, which allows to achieve stability and quite impressive results.

Today I would like to tell you a little about it and show how easy it can be integrated with OpenNebula using linstor_un – a new driver that I developed specifically for this purpose.

Linstor in combination with OpenNebula will allow you to build a high-performance and reliable cloud, which you can easily deploy on your own infrastructure.
