Lately, I’ve been seeing more and more debates about two popular GitOps tools: Argo CD and Flux CD.

Actually, I find such debates to be unfounded because I’m deeply convinced that both tools deserve attention and each of them is good for solving its own set of problems.

In my professional activities I use both. I want to share with you my opinion and use cases. I hope this article will help you choose the most suitable tool for your needs.
